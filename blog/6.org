/This is an old post from klltkr.com repeated here for completeness./

In December I released a curses client allowing playback of music stored/purchased with Google Play. The client is written in python and uses [[http://www.simonmweber.com/][Simon Weber's]] [[https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API][unofficial Google Music API]]. Details can be found on [[https://github.com/nomogram/thunner][the github page]].

It's still a [[https://github.com/nomogram/thunner/issues][work in progress]] but I have been able to use it as my sole music player.

Here's a picture of what it looks like: Screenshot of thunner running in terminal
