/This is an old post from klltkr.com repeated here for completeness./

Some terminal emulators, such as xterm and urxvt, allow an internal border to be defined, offsetting the terminal text from the edge of the window. I find this to be very aesthetically pleasing. As urxvt was giving me issues with copy and paste I thought I'd try using Konsole. Unfortunately Konsole has no equivalent option to internalBorder so I thought all hope was lost.

However, recently I've been playing around with KDE and Qt and I happened upon this nugget of information: Qt applications can be styled with CSS and this can be applied by passing a stylesheet as a command-line option to the application:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
konsole -stylesheet style.css
#+END_SRC

Then using the following stylesheet I can add a margin to the Konsole window and by setting the background colour to match the background colour Konsole uses for text I achieved the same effect as internalBorder on urxvt.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
QWidget {
    margin: 9;
    background-color: #eeeeee;
}
#+END_SRC

Here's what my urxvt looks like: Screenshot of urxvt window with internalBorder

...and here's what Konsole looks like: Screenshot of konsole window with CSS stylsheet

Note also that I hide the tab bar and menu bar by default.

Hope this helps someone.
